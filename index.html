      ABOUT US
    </h1>
    <p class="words hidden">
      DAUATHACHDUA is a non-profit organization created by Mr Thien with his weekly supply of a dish with the same name
      in order to nurture
      the dream and potential of future generations. This year, the organization welcomes 5 new beneficiaries with
      unique strengths and weaknesses to prepare them for the upcoming national competition. And here are the 6 current
      members: </p>
    <ul class="hidden">
      <li id='Anh'>Nguyễn Ngọc Châu Anh</li>
      <li id='Linh'>Kiều Nguyễn Khiết Linh</li>
      <li id='Nghi'>Lê Thanh Nghị</li>
      <li id='me'>Nguyễn Tiến Nhân</li>
      <li id='Nhat'>Trần Đại Nhật</li>
      <li id='Quynh'>Nguyễn Như Quỳnh</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="hidden">In addition, the organization was also founded for an environmental cause. As climate change is
      deteriorating, countless species of animal are plummeting in number and some are on the verge of extinction. Thus,
      we choose the Koalas as our mascot not only because of its adorable appearance but also to raise awareness about
      its rapidly declining population (from between 46,000 and 82,000 in 2018 to between 32,000 and 58,000 in 2021,
      changing its status from vulnerable to endangered)</p>
    <p class="hidden">With those two purposes in mind, DAUATHACHDUA aimed to provide the most holistic form of education
      to the 6 koalas with the help of 5(+3) teachers and experts in the field. Moreover, opportunities for relaxation
      were also presented with frequent visits to a local cafe as well as a 10-day trip to a faraway land in the North
      (more details in the <a href="#events">Events</a> section). </p>
    <p class="hidden">After spending 5 months with each other, countless memories, from the dearest ones to the more
      disastrous ones, were made and may never fade away. This website serves to somewhat capture the most memorable
      features and interactions within those 5 months and also to pay tribute to all the "dedication" and "hard work" of
      the members throughout the period. What lies ahead of the 6 of them, not only academically but also in their
      personal endeavors as a whole, let us wish nothing but the best for them. I hope you have a great time visiting
      our website.

        the mentors, the scholars, (and other synonyms of "teachers" that you can find online), whose contributions

    <div class="randomtext hidden" id="teach">So after the teachers are familiarized with, below this is the the crux of
      this website: the 6 individuals that make up the whole team. Each of them would have a section describing their
      characteristics (depending on the perspectives of the other 5, which are extremely biased and maybe even filled
      with inside jokes) and another one to display their thoughts and feelings about the journey. So let's start with
      the first one: </div>

      <h1 class="title">EVENTS</h1>
      <p>To provide some initial context, prior to joining the National team, we expected that this course would last
        for no more than 3 months and it would be an extremely hostile and conservative environment filled with
        competitive and nerdy individuals being interested only in their studying. Nevertheless, these anticipations
        couldn’t be further from the truth. Moreover, each day usually starts at 7:30 and ends at 10:30 am (so yeah, you
        can see that the schedule was very easy-going with the team). And without further ado, let start with the day
        that begins it all:</p>

          <h2>Event</h2>
          <small>January 1st</small>
          <p>This lesson introduced us to another National team from Khanh Hoa who are overall better than us, which, as
            Mrs Fairy Godmother said, would encourage us to improve ourselves. Moreover, the professor ( Mr Homework)
            that was going to teach us is notoriously known for his talent but also his short fuse. Thus, saying that we
            needed to walk on eggshells while studying with him is an understatement.
          </p>
          <p>The first day had every fucking feature that made it uncomfortable: the heavy rain, the gloomy sky, and
            especially the freezing temperature, all of which foreboded a miserable day. However, everything turned out
            better than anyone could have anticipated. The other team was friendly and approachable and even gifted us
            Nha Trang’s socks. We also thought of a slogan for ourselves and in retrospect, it was so cringeworthy.
            Meanwhile, the expert was surprisingly amiable and taught us a lot of useful stuff. Yet his one flaw is his
            unpunctuality, always arriving at least 30 minutes late each lesson.
          </p>
          <p>The following days happened similarly to one another: Mr Homework taught us interesting lessons and unique
            approaches to each kind of exercises, and the Khanh Hoa team tried their bests to flaunt their talents as
            well as skills whereas our team tried our bests not to embarrass ourselves. All in all, </p>
