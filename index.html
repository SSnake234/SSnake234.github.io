      ABOUT US
    </h1>
    <p class="words hidden">
      DAUATHACHDUA is a non-profit organization created by six individuals that make up the English National team of 2022-2023 with its name being inspired by Mr Thien and his weekly supply of a dish with the same name. (It is pronounced Da ua thạch dừa (jelly yogurt) if you are confused).The six members are all talented people with unique strengths and characteristics of their own. And here are the 6 founders: </p>
    <ul class="hidden">
      <li id='Anh'>Nguyễn Ngọc Châu Anh</li>
      <li id='Linh'>Kiều Nguyễn Khiết Linh</li>
      <li id='Nghi'>Lê Thanh Nghị</li>
      <li id='me'>Nguyễn Tiến Nhân</li>
      <li id='Nhat'>Trần Đại Nhật</li>
      <li id='Quynh'>Nguyễn Như Quỳnh</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="hidden">In addition, the organization was also founded for an environmental cause. As climate change is
      deteriorating, countless species of animal are plummeting in number and some are on the verge of extinction. Thus,
      we choose the Koalas as our mascot not only because of its adorable appearance but also to raise awareness about
      its rapidly declining population (from between 46,000 and 82,000 in 2018 to between 32,000 and 58,000 in 2021,
      changing its status from vulnerable to endangered)</p>
    <p class="hidden">With those two purposes in mind, DAUATHACHDUA aimed to introduce you, the reader, to how life within the National team looks like and inspire those from the next generations to get into the National team the following years (but I doubt anyone born before 2007 would read this though). And if you think that it is pretty uninteresting, then you are just fucking dead wrong. Moreover, this website also serves to somewhat capture the most memorable
      features and interactions within those 5-6 months and also to pay tribute to all the "dedication" and "hard work" of
      the members throughout the period. I hope you will have a great time reading this website. So now, let's get familiarized with the people of the team</p>

        OUR PEOPLE
      </h1>
      <p>This section serves to showcase the individuals that had accompanied the organization throughout the
        half-a-year period. To begin, let's take a brief look at the teachers, the professors, the educators, the
        tutors,
        the mentors, the scholars, (and other synonyms of "teachers" that you can find online), whose contributions
        meant everything to the personal and academic development of the six students: </p>

      this website: the 6 individuals that make up the whole team. Each of them would have a section describing their
      characteristics (depending on the perspectives of the other 5, which are definitely not biased) and another one to
      display their thoughts and feelings about the journey. So let's start with
      the first one: </div>

        <ul class="hidden">
          <li id="Linh">A Scorpio who acts like a Pisces. Although her "vô tri" moments constantly leave me speechless, they greatly contribute to her cuteness and gradually become an indispensable feature of this dreamy girl.</li>
          <li id="Nghi">She may come across as a “mysterious, introvert, lowkey” type of girl, but that could be no further from the truth: she randomly laughs for 5 minutes during class. Nonetheless, she is very cute, with many adorable expressions and behaviour, making her seems like a cat. Also she can manage to stay awake despite watching 541232 episodes of her favourite show the previous night.</li>
          <li id="me">Randomly dance during the middle of the class to a song that she heard from TikTok the previous day. Have the magical ability to get 10 listening questions wrong yet still had maximum score. If anyone in the class cannot find their stuff, then it was probably hidden by her</li>
          <li id="Nhat">Literally a girl from nowhere. No one ever knows where she just stopped by before she comes to class, be it the magical world of Tik Tok or a surreal dimension from the film she watched the night before. Sometimes she knows everything, sometimes she knows nothing. She’s cheeky, real and sentimental at the same time!</li>
          <li id="Quynh">“The surprising/ deceptive factor?”: ‼️Take every word of her with a grain of salt! A girl with inexplicably simple dreams and a perplexing taste of food. A genuine daydreamer who makes me stand still sometimes 🙉</li>

          <li id="Anh">The girl will roast the hell out of you with that high-pitched, judging tone. Her future students should be on their knees right now 'cuz their beloved teacher is already scheming to make their lives a living hell ☠️. However, I am always surprised by how sympathetic and delicate she could be especially after that one time 🤭. Still don’t know what she meant by “intellectual status” tho 😃</li>
          <li id="Nghi">The leader of our group, she never fears to express her true feelings towards a person (for which I admire her). However, she leaves everything about her future and ambitions in secrecy and tends to disappear into thin air during parties. During study time, she is the one who receive the most compliments from teachers (even the experts from prestigious universities) and also, she is the best at writing (despite coining the term “intellectual status”) Anyway, she is really lovely and never gets angry with me (ilysm)</li>
          <li id="me">The stern and disciplined senior, always complaining about how noisy others (especially the 2 juniors) are. Usually searched for her horoscope online to see how lucky she was on a specific day. With her writing talent and dedication, she was the one to write all the captions for our Instagram posts about the 10-day trip to Hanoi, which she also made plans for. We are sometimes curious about her private life and ambition which are still shrouded in mystery.</li>
          <li id="Nhat">The always-be-myself and strong-willed girl whom i most admire. She teaches me not to compromise my own values to please others. She radiates boldness, confidence and uniqueness. I’m not saying that she doesn’t know how to love and care, though. Kieu is the mother hen of @dauathachdua, always caring, leading the other mischievous chicks. Can’t imagine what a chaos it would be without her.</li>
          <li id="Quynh">“The leader”: A confident, perfectionist girl who claims to have impeccable beauty ( indisputably, all of her works are 💯/💯). However, when you get close enough to her, you will figure out that she is surprisingly hilarious in a sarcastic way. And damn, this girl is so good at scolding or accusing people in a polite and academic but still powerful way 😎🤘</li>

          <li id="Anh">The vlogger of our group. He really likes to text without dấu even though we would mistranslate his messages. Besides his immaculate music taste and the ability to get every jokes, he is also another trustworthy junior whom i adore ( but will not forgive for having started the “xà lơ” thing 😡) Lastly, his silence terrifies me ( Nghi, if you are reading this then yes, im talking about the time at the Mausoleum and yes, i am still sorry for hiding your glasses 😃 )</li>
          <li id="Linh">A kinda mysterious boy who always feels unreasonably sorry for not being the best in a competition (although he nailed it), who can admirably stay away from gossip, and who never calls me "chị"  (instead of "bà"). Btw, taking a photo with him is not recommended if you don't want to have your spotlight stolen by his "Sherlock Holmes facial expression".</li>
          <li id="me">The most photogenic individual one can ever meet, yet never seems to smile in any photograph (he still looks good though). He is also a frequent victim of having his stuff stolen and hidden. If you see me and him laughing hysterically in class, we probably just made some dirty jokes.</li>
          <li id="Nhat">Like an ancient tree in age-old fairy tales, Nghi rarely speaks during our gossip sessions. Instead, he tells ”votri” jokes from time to time and occasionally utters “funnified” sounds that make us laugh. Notwithstanding his taciturn nature, Nghi wins people over with his charming smile, super handsome look and cute manners. Also, he never speaks ill of others and always guide us all towards a more positive attitude in life :3</li>
          <li id="Quynh">“The visual of the group”: A gifted boy who always says he didn't do the tests well. He knows how to uplift his listeners though not a highly skilled storyteller 🦅🦅</li>

Also, he should stop making all the nasty hand signs (especially the middle finger). The kind of person who is most likely to laugh at some deadass dad jokes 🤓. Him being cut off by the 2 noisy juniors and not being able to say a thing was really funny to me</li>

Besides, he’s the one who creates and constructs this webpage. What makes me most appreciative of was his ability to understand all my dirty jokes in class. Also, he is easily recognized for his curly hair and cute appearance that make you want to caress. (Sometimes people may think he’s my little brother 💀)</li>
          <li id="Nhat">If he wants something, he gets it. If he likes something, he sticks to it. In my eyes, Tien is a tiny fluffy handsome boy with a gleaming smile, always talking in his own words and joking his own way. Six months with him made me realize that carefreeness is not his only characteristic, he’s also a caring and affectionate brother of us two naughty boys. Anyone would adore the way he looks around making sure we have not gone missing on the way to Ms. Duyen’s class!</li>

Despite some of his wrongdoings, he is one of the most crucial factors contributing to the lively ambience that our team enjoyed everyday for the past 6 months. Oh and also, he usually regards me as adorable in a tiny way due to our heigth difference.</li>

      <p>To provide some initial context, prior to joining the National team, we expected that this course would last
        for no more than 3 months and it would be an extremely hostile and conservative environment filled with
        competitive and nerdy individuals being interested only in their studying. Nevertheless, these anticipations
        couldn’t be further from the truth. Moreover, each day usually starts at 7:30 and ends at 10:30 am (so yeah, you
        can see that the schedule was very easy-going with the team). If you want to see the original size of all the pictures below, just simply click on it. And without further ado, let start with the day
        that begins it all:</p>

          <h2>The very first day</h2>
          <small>September 27th</small>
          <p>This was on Monday so according to Mrs Fairy Godmother, we needed to attend the Flag Salutation Period before beginning our lesson. For each and every one of us, it was preciously reserved as a chance to socialize and to keep in touch with the outside world. Yet, no sooner had we been seated than Mr. Thien, whose name stands for kindness and tolerance, forced us to come back to study immediately. Suddenly, the sky stumbled down in front of us and the English room looked like a jail. </p>
          <p>Beginning the lesson, we were bombarded with a lecture full of writing (especially the “Double Counter Argument”) and speaking guidance while the world outside was full of laughter and the resonance of songs. However, things soon kicked in and we had no choice but to enjoy our lecture. As a compensation, Mr. Thien asked us out to a local cafe to wind up a bit (which eventually became a routine during his lessons).</p>
          <p>And it was during this first day that the name "Dauathachdua" was made (because most of us ordered that drink), together with the creation of our Zalo and Messenger groups where countless stories and images still remain.</p>
          <p>During the following days, we started to get more comfortable with each other as well as the lessons which helped to alleviate the stressful atmosphere that had been lingering since day one. However, a forthcoming event was about to change everything...</p>

          <h2>First lessons with an expert</h2>
          <small>October 14th</small>
          <p>This lesson introduced us to another National team from Khanh Hoa who are overall better than us, which, as Mrs Fairy Godmother said, would encourage us to improve ourselves. Moreover, the professor (whose name’s acronym sounds like Homework) that was going to teach us is notoriously known for his talent but also his short fuse, so saying that we needed to walk on eggshells while studying with him is an understatement. 
          </p>
          <p>The first day had every fucking feature that made it uncomfortable: the heavy rain, the gloomy sky, and especially the freezing temperature, all of which foreboded a miserable day. However, everything turned out better than anyone could have anticipated. The other team was friendly and approachable and even gifted us socks. Meanwhile, Mr Homework was surprisingly amiable and taught us a lot of useful stuff. But at the end of the day, a piece of information from the expert sent shock waves across every student and teacher of not only the English faculty but every other subject as well. Remember two paragraphs ago where I said that this course had been expected to last only 3 months? Well, according to Mr Homework, it would be prolonged for another 2-3 months due to internal issues. So yeah, everyone’s plan and mindset for this year was changed dramatically, yet we couldn’t do anything except embrace it and push ahead.

          </h2>
          <small>October 14th-16th</small>
          <p>The following days happened similarly to one another: Mr Homework arrived at least 30 minutes late each lesson and taught us interesting and unique approaches to each kind of exercises. Meanwhile, the Khanh Hoa team tried their bests to flaunt their talents as well as skills whereas our team tried our best not to embarrass ourselves.</p>
          <p>And after three grueling days of studying, we had a feast with Mr Homework and the other team. It happened so long ago so the memories are kinda vague now but the things that I can remember are Dai Nhat’s bottomless stomach ( he continued eating while the others were all full ) and Thanh Nghi’s dry jokes.</p>
          <p>By the end of the feast, we said goodbye to the other team as well as the expert with a photoshoot. However, this would not be the final time we saw or studied with each other…</p>

          <p>We heard about the camp 5-6 weeks before it happened and initially, it was only for the 10th and 11th Grades. Nevertheless, Mrs Fairy Godmother asked 6 of us if we wanted to go or not and we said yes. Thus, she made some exceptions and we eventually stole 6 slots from others (no regrets). We also prepared a singing performance for the camp (except Nhan and Chanh since they are socially awkward)</p>
          <p>The day came and each of us was allocated to be a supporter for each crew (there were 12 of them which came from 12 cities and towns in Lam Dong) together with another supporter from Bao Loc High school for the gifted. However, as time went on, we realized that we were there just for the sake of being there since all of the crews had prepared everything beforehand so we couldn’t help much besides cheering them up. It may take us a whole 350-word-ish essay to fully tell you our experience at the camping site, so I would like to sum up the whole thing with 3 words only: <span class="weighty">surprised</span> at the young campers’ skills and dedication, <span class="weighty">grateful</span> for having had the chance to befriend the supporters from BLHSFTG as well as some of our English-majored juniors (and maybe for the chance to eat literally everything on Earth), and also… <span class="weighty">exhausted</span>. Long story short, we still think that it was a day (and a half?) well spent, which is worth adding into our “holy” timeline.</p>

          <h2>The Ha Noi trip</h2>
          <small>September 12th - January 2nd</small>
          <p>These 10 days were the culmination of our most unforgettable memories with stressful lessons full of peer pressure (caused by friends from a specific coastal region) accompanied by incredibly eventful yet exhausting trips (có 10,000 bước mỗi ngày chứ nhiêu). If you want a more detailed narration of each day, visit our Instagram. But if you are too lazy to click even a button, then this website shall try to encapsulate the essence of the trip using my summarizing ability that I have learnt for 2 years:</p>
          <p>The journey to Hanoi was a life-changing experience for all of us. To begin with, the crash course gave us invaluable insights into how to ace the writing and speaking sections of the test, which shifted our mindset towards the two experts' approach to the upcoming NEC (I’m not saying that we didn’t have to deal with peer pressure from our fellow mates from Khanh Hoa, though). Also, we were pleasantly surprised by the delicious Hanoian cuisines we got to try, including "miến ngan", "bún thang", and "bún chả", etc. In addition, we had the chance to explore the capital's landmarks and embark on a one-day field trip to the magnificent city of Ninh Binh. However, the journey wasn't all about enjoyment. We did fall out some times over some trivial matters. Despite such setbacks, these moments helped us to forge a more concrete relationship. Overall, it was a transformative experience that we will always cherish.</p>

Some of us arrived at the class on time, some arrived late, and besides doing tons of practice tests, we also spent a large amount of time talking and messing around in class. As time passed, the exam days got closer and closer, and a week before that, we enjoyed the last feast with each other as well as with every teacher from the English faculty…</p>
          <p>All 6 of us chose to meet at school before going to the restaurant and one extraordinary thing happened: Khiet Linh was the last one to arrive. Knowing this was a one in a million opportunity, we decided to seize it and chose a place to hide from her (the basement opposite B11). After arriving without seeing us, Linh called Tien’s phone only to be greeted by Nhat’s ear-splitting voice at the other end of the line saying batshit crazy stuff. We could hear her voice getting more and more annoyed through the phone so we decided to show up, each laughing uncontrollably.</p>
          <p>After pulling ourselves together, we got on our motorbikes and started riding to the restaurant. All of us arrived at the venue one after another, well, ALMOST all of us, except Nhat. He, despite not knowing where the destination was, decided to continue riding straight. He did that so confidently that we thought we were the one to have the wrong restaurant. Yet after a moment, he sensed something was wrong and turned around, going back the street before eventually arriving at the restaurant</p>
          <p>The feast itself wasn’t that eventful, us students sat as a group and goofed around with each other like 6 year-olds. Adjacent to us were the teachers and they also mostly chatted with one another and would sometimes interact with us. So yeah… that is the gist of the feast. But after that, we still wanted to go somewhere with each other so we went to “Chè Hẻm” to enjoyed some dish there before going to Big C to walk around the bookstore. The day ended with us going up to the roof of Big C to take some photos and we all went home, preparing for the last week prior to the exam.</p>

  <div class="randomtext hidden">So this is the end of the website, we extremely appreciate those who have read the whole website and we hope that you had a great time doing so. We would also like to express our gratitude towards the 5 teachers who had accompanied the team and tolerate us day by day.
    <p class="hidden">After spending 5 months with each other, countless      memories, from the dearest ones to the more disastrous ones, were made and may never fade away. Unfortunately, this is also the end of the journey for 4 individuals of the team, but at least they had this chaotic journey to reminisce about in the future. About the two juniors, they still have 1 year left of high school, and I am adamant they will have the most eventful last year than anyone could fathom. All in all, what lies ahead of the 6 of them, not only academically but also in their
      personal endeavors as a whole, let us wish nothing but the best for them.
    </p>
    <p class="hidden">And to those who are our next generations and want to join the National team the following years, starting your studying right now would not be a bad idea. Just begin with aiming to get into Thang Long high school for the gifted, and I am pretty sure that there is a specific programme made by TL-ers who are eager to tutor you through the whole journey. And with that, goodbye, and see you later...</p>
