      ABOUT US
    </h1>
    <p class="words hidden">
      DAUATHACHDUA is a non-profit organization created by Mr Thien with his weekly supply of a dish with the same name
      in order to nurture
      the dream and potential of future generations. This year, the organization welcomes 5 new beneficiaries with
      unique strengths and weaknesses to prepare them for the upcoming national competition. And here are the 6 current
      members: </p>
    <ul class="hidden">
      <li id='Anh'>Nguyễn Ngọc Châu Anh</li>
      <li id='Linh'>Kiều Nguyễn Khiết Linh</li>
      <li id='Nghi'>Lê Thanh Nghị</li>
      <li id='me'>Nguyễn Tiến Nhân</li>
      <li id='Nhat'>Trần Đại Nhật</li>
      <li id='Quynh'>Nguyễn Như Quỳnh</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="hidden">In addition, the organization was also founded for an environmental cause. As climate change is
      deteriorating, countless species of animal are plummeting in number and some are on the verge of extinction. Thus,
      we choose the Koalas as our mascot not only because of its adorable appearance but also to raise awareness about
      its rapidly declining population (from between 46,000 and 82,000 in 2018 to between 32,000 and 58,000 in 2021,
      changing its status from vulnerable to endangered)</p>
    <p class="hidden">With those two purposes in mind, DAUATHACHDUA aimed to provide the most holistic form of education
      to the 6 koalas with the help of 5(+3) teachers and experts in the field. Moreover, opportunities for relaxation
      were also presented with frequent visits to a local cafe as well as a 10-day trip to a faraway land in the North
      (more details in the <a href="#events">Events</a> section). </p>
    <p class="hidden">After spending 5 months with each other, countless memories, from the dearest ones to the more
      disastrous ones, were made and may never fade away. This website serves to somewhat capture the most memorable
      features and interactions within those 5 months and also to pay tribute to all the "dedication" and "hard work" of
      the members throughout the period. What lies ahead of the 6 of them, not only academically but also in their
      personal endeavors as a whole, let us wish nothing but the best for them. I hope you have a great time visiting
      our website.

      <p>This section serves to showcase the individuals that had accompanied the organization throughout the
        half-a-year period. To begin, let's take a brief look at the teachers, the professors, the educators, the
        tutors,
        the mentors, the scholars, (and other synonyms of "teachers" that you can find online), whose contributions
        meant everything to the personal and academic development of the six students: </p>

      <p>To provide some initial context, prior to joining the National team, we expected that this course would last
        for no more than 3 months and it would be an extremely hostile and conservative environment filled with
        competitive and nerdy individuals being interested only in their studying. Nevertheless, these anticipations
        couldn’t be further from the truth. Moreover, each day usually starts at 7:30 and ends at 10:30 am (so yeah, you
        can see that the schedule was very easy-going with the team). And without further ado, let start with the day
        that begins it all:</p>

          <h2>The very first day</h2>
          <small>September 27th</small>
          <p>This was on Monday so according to Mrs Fairy Godmother, we needed to attend the Flag Salutation Period before beginning our lesson. For each and every one of us, it was preciously reserved as a chance to socialize and to keep in touch with the outside world. Yet, no sooner had we been seated than Mr. Thien, whose name stands for kindness and tolerance, forced us to come back to study immediately. Suddenly, the sky stumbled down in front of us and the English room looked like a jail. </p>
          <p>Beginning the lesson, we were bombarded with a lecture full of writing (especially the “Double Counter Argument”) and speaking guidance while the world outside was full of laughter and the resonance of songs. However, things soon kicked in and we had no choice but to enjoy our lecture. As a compensation, Mr. Thien asked us out to a local cafe to wind up a bit (which eventually became a routine during his lessons).</p>
          <p>And it was during this first day that the name "Dauathachdua" was made (because most of us ordered that drink), together with the creation of our Zalo and Messenger groups where countless stories and images still remain.</p>
          <p>During the following days, we started to get more comfortable with each other as well as the lessons which helped to alleviate the stressful atmosphere that had been lingering since day one. However, a forthcoming event was about to change everything...</p>

          <h2>First lessons with an expert</h2>
          <small>October 14th</small>
          <p>This lesson introduced us to another National team from Khanh Hoa who are overall better than us, which, as Mrs Fairy Godmother said, would encourage us to improve ourselves. Moreover, the professor (whose name’s acronym sounds like Homework) that was going to teach us is notoriously known for his talent but also his short fuse, so saying that we needed to walk on eggshells while studying with him is an understatement. 
          </p>
          <p>The first day had every fucking feature that made it uncomfortable: the heavy rain, the gloomy sky, and especially the freezing temperature, all of which foreboded a miserable day. However, everything turned out better than anyone could have anticipated. The other team was friendly and approachable and even gifted us socks. Meanwhile, Mr Homework was surprisingly amiable and taught us a lot of useful stuff. But at the end of the day, a piece of information from the expert sent shock waves across every student and teacher of not only the English faculty but every other subject as well. Remember two paragraphs ago where I said that this course had been expected to last only 3 months? Well, according to Mr Homework, it would be prolonged for another 2-3 months due to internal issues. So yeah, everyone’s plan and mindset for this year was changed dramatically, yet we couldn’t do anything except embrace it and push ahead.
